                        <p>
                            This GitHub page was created as part of the project “History as a Visual Concept: Peter of Poitiers’ Compendium historiae”,
                            generously funded by the DFG (504265959) and the FWF (I 6133) under the Weave European funding scheme.
                            The project ran from 2023 to 2026. During this period, researchers at the University of Tübingen, the University of Wuppertal,
                            the University of Graz, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, and the University of London are producing the
                            <a href="https://gams.uni-graz.at/context:chigc" target="_blank">first digital edition of Peter of Poitiers’ Compendium historiae </a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The research team at the Department of Digital Humanities at the University of Graz focused in particular on integrating
                            image data into the digital edition using the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).
                            The team collaborated with the CLARIAH-AT–funded project “IIIF in Digital Editions” (Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna) in organizing a workshop on this topic:

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, in collaboration with the project DiTAH (Digitale Transformation der Österreichischen Geisteswissenschaften) a
                            <a href="https://www.ditah.at/iiif" target="_blank">tutorial for the implementation of IIIF in digital editions</a> was created.
                            Within the project “History as a Visual Concept,” selected manuscripts were edited, and their images were annotated and linked
                            to corresponding transcriptions and translations. These manuscripts represent different graph versions of the Compendium.
                            In addition, numerous other manuscript images are available online and can be integrated via IIIF.
                            In a case study the project team in Graz has created a collection of the available and openly licensed IIIF manifest data and images,
                            allowing for the comparison of manuscripts via the Mirador Viewer (Project Mirador).
                            The collection is grouped by Graph Version to facilitate comparison. Please note that our project is not the host for these images.
                            For image rights, kindly contact the respective hosting institutions.
